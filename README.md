# Guitar-Fretboard-Flashcards
Simple python flashcard program for memorizing notes on a guitar fretboard

To run the Python script, enter:
$ ./Master_Flashcard.py <name_of_flashcard_set>

The flashcard sets (e.g. the "fretboard_notes" file) should be stored in $HOME/.flashcards/
where each file defines an array called 'cards' for the question/answer values.
